# Vārtā
A stackechange for research articles


**Vārtā (वार्ता)**:—(nf) a talk; talks, negotiation; **Origin** _Sanskrit_ 

The project Vārtā attempts to create is an open-source project aimed at bridging the gap between published research and the practical experiences of scientists through scientific dialogue. Born from the challenges faced during doctoral research, this platform addresses a critical issue in academia: the lack of accessible information about replication attempts, especially unsuccessful ones. While published papers primarily focus on successful outcomes, the scientific process often involves numerous failed attempts and unexpected challenges. These experiences, though valuable, rarely find their way into formal literature.

Our platform enables researchers to share their experiences with published papers, including replication attempts, methodological challenges, and alternative interpretations. By entering a paper's DOI, users can access a dedicated discussion thread where they can post their insights, read about others' experiences, and engage in constructive dialogue. Features include structured feedback categories, author verification for direct input from paper writers, and community-driven content curation through voting and tagging systems. The platform also offers data visualization of replication success rates through upvotes and tools for collaboration on replication studies.

This project aims to foster transparency in scientific research, save valuable time and resources for researchers, and potentially improve the overall quality of published work. By creating a space for open dialogue about the full spectrum of research experiences, we hope to accelerate scientific progress and promote a more collaborative research environment. Whether you're a seasoned researcher, a graduate student, or simply interested in the scientific process, we welcome your contributions to building this crucial tool for the scientific community.
